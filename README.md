# Chordulator
A toy for experimenting with music theory

OR

Perhaps it's a new type of instrument?

This tool was inspired by the diatonic harmonica.

The aim of this tool is to let you play music by choosing which chords and intervals you're playing, rather than playing specific notes and training your muscle memory to find the chords.
